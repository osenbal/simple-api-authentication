# Authentication API

programming language : node JS
framework : express JS
author : Oceanbal

# Detail Project

The API authentication process validates the identity of the client attempting to make a connection by using an authentication protocol.
In this project Iam using JWT Token for validation.
why used JWT ? because JWT create a secure encodes token, sterilizes, and adds a signature with a secret key. And JWT have a expires time that supports our tokens are not always alive.

Database : NO SQL (MongoDB)
Why use MongoDB ? because mongodb is simple databse for beginer and this and it matches javascript because the data is a json
